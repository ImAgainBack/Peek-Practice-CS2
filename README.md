# Peek-Practice-CS2
Yprac like .cfg files to train your prefire skill

We share with you our .cfg files that you can use ton train your peek like Yprac before in csgo.

To initialize your server you have to:

Put .cfg files in SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg

Then use the command in the cs2 terminal: exec infernobots
if its for inferno and change the name according to each map.

When you are on a map and launched the infernobots file you have to press "p" to change place on the map
or to press "[" to replay this section.

Watch out about some restrictions we have for the moment on CS2.
For instance you can't spawn more than 10 bots each time, thats why you have to press "p" or "o"

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
